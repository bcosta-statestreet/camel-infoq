Camel Introduction Project
==========================

This is an Eclipse project. Nevertheless, it can be used via console, or imported into NetBeans / IntelliJ IDEA. 

Libraries are imported via Maven to ease dependecy management. 
You should always use the newest version of Camel before starting (current version: 2.9.0).

Run the UnitTest (IntegrationTest.java). Put a breakpoint into the debugger and start playing around.
You can also start the main method of CamelStarter.java and copy the real_order.csv file to the inbox directory
(within 30 seconds) to see how it is processed. 

Have fun with Apache Camel.
